# ZeroLabModules
This is currently my lab/sandbox for continued learning about [VCV-Rack](https://vcvrack.com/) and DSP programming.

Inside you will find a collection of experimental modules and library components of varying degrees of completion.
Some of them might make good code reading, some of them, not so much.

The majority of my learning about DSP has been from the following books and I've ***tried*** to give credit as due at the
top of each code file.
- [BasicSynth](http://basicsynth.com/) by Daniel R. Mitchell. I have to say that I don't cite this book often because it was
the first book I read on the topic and my earlier experiements aren't present here to cite, so I have to say: I found this book
friendly and "easy" (DSP-easy that is) to get started with and all of the DSP code that I write now is somehow influenced by it.
- [Designing Audio Effect Plug-Ins in C++](https://www.willpirkle.com/about/books/) by [Will Pirkle](http://www.willpirkle.com/)
- [Designing Software Synthesizer Plug-Ins in C++](https://www.willpirkle.com/about/books/) by [Will Pirkle](http://www.willpirkle.com/)

#### Notes on Will Pirkle's Books
While BasicSynth is a good start into DSP, Will Pirkle takes you deep into the depths of the topic which clear writing, useful diagrams,
charts, graphs, etc, and real code and projects. He has a number of audio development tools available that look really useful, but I haven't
played with them yet. NOTE: I have the first editions of his books (linked above) and the [2nd editions](https://www.amazon.com/s?i=stripbooks&rh=p_27%3AWill+Pirkle) look to be updated quite a bit so I'm
sure that they are even better.
