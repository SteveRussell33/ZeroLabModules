AudioLib Design:

What it will have:
- constants
- filter classes
- osc classes
- ???

Files:
constants.hpp
- common constants

oscillator.hpp
- base classes
- core-classes
- osc algorithm

osc-lab.hpp
- easy to experiment with classes
- interesting implementations of oscillator.hpp
- interesting but currently unused

filter.hpp
- base classes and core-classes

filter-lab.hpp
- easy to experiment with classes
- interesting implementations of filter.hpp
